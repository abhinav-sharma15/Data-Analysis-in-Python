# Data Analysis in Python

Set of 5 Jupyter notebooks covering various tasks commonly put into use for data analysis in Python.
The five notebooks are arranged interms of broad groups of tasks - 

1. **Loading.ipynb** - Reading and writing with a varirty of file formats and data stores
2. **Preparation.ipynb** - Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing and tranforming data for analysis
3. **Transformation.ipynb** - Applying mathematical and statistical operations to groups of datasets to derive new datasets
4. **Modeling.ipynb** - Connecting your data to statistical models, ML algorithms, or other computational tools
5. **Presentation.ipynb** - Creating interactive or static graphical visualizations or textual summaries

Main focus is on **pandas** library for data analysis. However, we will also use - 
* **NumPy** - For numrical data, NumPy arrays are more efficient for storing and manipulating data comapred to other libraries. One of its primary uses in data analysis is as a container for data to be passed between algorithms and libraries.
* **Matplotlib** - for producing plots and other two-dimensional data visualizations.
* **scikit-learn** - prediction focused library for machine learning models.
